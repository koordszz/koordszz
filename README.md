# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @koordszz
## I'm an aspiring Cloud Specialist from the archipelago of the Philippines.
## I've been working in the customer support role for more than 10 years. I started as a call center support for many BPOs in the Philippines but switched to freelancing in 2019 just before the pandemic hits.
### I was learning React.js to build front-end apps but then it didn't really work out for me so now I'm working on becoming a cloud administrator, preferrably Azure. Right now, I'm working on getting the CCNA certification.
### I am looking for roles relevant to my experience, knowledge, and skills. You can check me on LinkedIn, too (https://www.linkedin.com/in/billy-j-g/).
